# Booking-data-BI-project-

This beginner level project is aimed towards finding actionable insights from a fictitious data. 

The data set contains booking information of three properties ( hotels ) with a room count of 60 each collected over a period of 31 days. 
The dataset contains the following columns:

  •	Booking ID (unique)

  •	Property ID (1, 2 or 3)

  •	Booking Amount (self-explanatory)

  •	Check-In Date (self-explanatory)

  •	Check-Out Date (self-explanatory)

  •	Rooms Booked (self-explanatory)

A new data set was generated to arrive at the per day collection of each property. Furthermore, the least performing property was identified. 

Although it was very tempting, Time Series Forecasting was not performed on the data because of such low period of collected data (31 days) .
